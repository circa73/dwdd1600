            <h1>Bicycles</h1>

            <p>A bicycle, is a human-powered or motor-assisted, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, with two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other. A bicycle rider is called a cyclist, or bicyclist.</p>
            
            <p>The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright or <em>safety</em> bicycle, has changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885. However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of <a href="frames.html#cfiber">modern materials</a> and computer-aided design. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of cycling.</p>

            <p>The bicycle's invention has had an <strong>enormous</strong> effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings, pneumatic tires, chain-driven sprockets, and tension-spoked wheels.</p>
