            <p>One of the things we love most about coffee is how many people and places it touches.  The journey of a coffee bean can travel several continents to get to your cup.  For example, the coffee beans could be grown by coffee farmers in Kenya before being roasted at a coffee roastery in Portugal, and, just like that, those African coffee beans have travelled across several time zones and countries before they become the cup of coffee in front of you.</p>
                
            <p>But it’s no longer just coffee travelling to the consumer.  With the rise of coffee tourism across the world, many of the best coffee countries are now seeing an increase in tourists travelling to experience coffee at different parts of the production chain.</p>

            <p>So, what is coffee tourism and how is it changing the world of coffee?</p>

            <p>While there are new types of coffee experiences and coffee-related travel popping up, the main types of coffee tourism fall into three main categories:</p>
            
            <dl>                
                <dt>Coffee Farms</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Whether you drink espresso-based coffee drinks like latte or cappuccino or prefer your coffee brewed using a filter method like French Press or AeroPress, all coffee starts its life in the same way.  On a coffee farm.</p>
                                          
                    <p>Coffee lovers have been able to visit the farms where their favourite beverage is grown for a long time, but it’s only in recent years that it’s become more common.  These tours are usually offered by local farmers.</p>
                    
                    <p>During this increasingly popular tourism experience, you’ll receive a full farm tour where you can see the coffee plants and learn about the process of coffee production from those who live and breathe it.  If you’re visiting a family farm, they may also invite you inside to try other family recipes!</p>
                </dd>

                <dt>Coffee Tastings</dt>

                <dd>
                    <p>Tours of coffee plantations generally include a coffee-tasting element to the experience.  However, coffee tasting is a popular type of coffee tourism in its own right.</p>
            
                    <p>While coffee tours of farms can only be offered by coffee growers, coffee tasting is becoming increasingly popular among coffee roasters and specialty coffee shops all over the world.  Coffee shop owners and roasters regularly offer tasting experiences that can be enjoyed by both locals and foreign visitors.</p>
                        
                    <p>Each coffee-tasting event is different, but is usually reserved for single-origin coffee.  Most experiences include different types of coffee and of several cups coffee made using different brewing methods for you to compare.</p>
                </dd>
                
                <dt>Coffee Culture Tours</dt>

                <dd>
                   <p>Coffee tours are another way to enjoy some coffee adventures on a trip to almost anywhere in the world.  Usually themed around a particular topic, a coffee culture tour of a city allows you to soak up some of the local coffee cultures and see how the popular beverage is enjoyed by local communities.</p>
                   
                   <p>Coffee tours can be as diverse as coffee itself, from sampling the best flat whites in Melbourne and having your own design created in 3D latte art in Tokyo, to week-long treks through a coffee route in Ethiopia.</p>
                </dd>

            </dl>
